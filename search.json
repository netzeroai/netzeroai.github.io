    "text": "Workshop resources\nThis page outlines resources that will be useful during the workshop and serves as a guide.\n\nFront board\nThe board is split into four main themes and one ancillary section. These themes correspond to areas that are important from a sustainability perspective:\n\nSustainable aviation fuel\nAirport energy & infrastructure\nEmissions & contrails\nAircraft and airport waste\n\nThis list is not exhaustive, and during the workshop if other themes emerge, they will be included or merged with these four. Below these headers, participants are invited to write down thoughts on what role AI can play on provided post-it notes. Some broadstrokes may include:\n\ncalculating, monitoring, or forecasting different quantities that can help better understand anthropogenic climate drivers (e.g., energy consumption, warming due to emissions and persistent contrails, estimating humidity at altitute);\nidentifying new strategies or initiatives that can reduce anthropogenic climate forcing (e.g., flight path optimization, SAF feedstock optimization);\nevaluating the success of existing and future policy (e.g., using agent-based models).\n\nThe ancillary section of the board, titled Aspiration, is reserved for participants to write down what they hope to learn or achieve through this workshop. During registration (while collecting badges), all participants will be asked to write their aspirations on a provided post-it note and place it under the Aspiration heading on the board.\nAt the end of the workshop, a picture of all the post-it notes will be taken and processed using a large language model (LLM) to generate 1-2 whitepaper drafts that will be shared with all the participants.\n\n\n\nWhite papers\nCambridge University Press’ Data-Centric Engineering journal has agreed to receive a 1-2 white papers that come out of this mini-workshop. These would be treated as invited papers and therefore they will go through an expedited review process. White papers will be coordinated with participants through Overleaf.\n\n\n\nQ&As\nDue to the technical and regulatory complexity of the workshop topics, participants are encouraged to write down any questions they may have. A shared document has been created where everyone can contribute questions and answers.\n\n\nIce-breaking session\nAll participants will be seated in small groups, and during the ice-breaking session, we will be passing a microphone around, asking some of the following questions:\n\nWhat do you do professionally?\nWhat about climate change (literally ice-breaking!) worries you the most?\nWhat about existing sustainability initiatives makes you feel optimistic?\nIn the spirit of getting to know each other, tell us one unexpected thing about yourself.\n\nHumorous Ice-Breakers (from an LLM):\n\nIf you could have any superpower to fight climate change, what would it be and why?\nWhat’s your favorite eco-friendly guilty pleasure? (e.g., bamboo toilet paper, reusable straws made of unicorn tears…)\nIf you were stranded on a desert island and could only bring three sustainable items, what would they be?\nIf you could design an AI-powered airplane, what ridiculous feature would you include for the sake of sustainability? (Bonus points for puns!)\nWhat’s the most absurd way you can imagine AI helping to reduce airplane contrails?\nIf you were an AI tasked with making aviation greener, what would your hilarious evil twin AI try to do instead?\nDescribe the most outlandish sustainable airport of the future, complete with AI-powered amenities.\nShare the funniest “greenwashing” attempt you’ve ever seen in the aviation industry."

    "text": "Below you will find more relevant background information.\n\n\nOn the ground, the focus will be on reducing Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions as defined by the Airport Carbon Accreditation program.\nScope 1 emissions are those directly generated by the airport (e.g. from its own vehicles and operations). Scope 3 emissions include indirect sources, such as aircraft emissions within the airport’s control. Airport infrastructure contributes significantly to global emissions, accounting for 10 to 16 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. While this represents only 2-5% of total aviation-related carbon emissions, the sector’s projected growth demands urgent action.\nTo address this, airports worldwide are undertaking ambitious sustainability projects. These range from retrofitting existing infrastructure to designing new buildings with sustainability in mind, as well as optimizing the use of existing energy resources. Better tracking of airport vehicles, taxing aircraft, and passenger movements using CCTV and non-optical sensors could guide further sustainability initiatives. This data can help reduce the unnecessary use of aircraft auxiliary power units, optimize ground vehicle movement, and improve the efficiency of fueling operations.\nWhile Scope 2 emissions (indirect, from purchased energy) fall outside the airport’s direct control, AI-driven solutions can forecast airport energy consumption, guiding more sustainable off-site power generation strategies.\nA compelling case exists for AI’s role in optimizing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. AI can help determine the most suitable feedstocks, considering production constraints and refining processes. It can factor in climate, crop yields, and waste product availability for such optimization. Researchers from Washington State University and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory are already using computational methods to optimize SAF distillation processes.\nIn the coming years, alcohol-to-SAF and syngas-to-SAF pathways are expected to scale rapidly due to feedstock availability. The significant infrastructural investment required presents clear opportunities for AI-driven planning and optimization.\n\n\n\nIn the air, the focus will be on flight optimization to minimize both \\(CO_2\\) and non-\\(CO_2\\) (e.g., contrails) effects. These can be broken down into (i) engine-specific actions for reducing fuel burn—e.g., optimizing engine washing cycles, and better characterization of component wear on fuel consumption; (ii) the impact of introducing sustainable aviation fuel; (iii) eliminating operational routing inefficiencies, aligned with enhanced monitoring of airframe and engine inputs, and (iv) reducing the contribution to contrails. While many of these ideas have been well publicized, what is opaque is how AI can catapult these initiatives. In some cases, airlines have been able to design individual flights that address factors (i)-(iv). However, they have been unable to scale these individual successes. It is expected that during the workshop the challenges associated with scaling such initiatives will be discussed in conjunction with the role AI can play. Additionally, a key thrust will revolve around how a combination of advanced weather models, large language models, and other AI advances can be adapted to better forecast what will happen, following any operational and policy decisions."
