    "abstract: \"The objective of this mini-workshop is to identify specific challenges and artificial intelligence (AI) driven solution strategies for reducing emissions in aviation – encompassing both airline and airports – within the next 3-5 years. Given this stringent deadline, the focus is on enhancing existing operations, infrastructure, and policy rather than developing new aircraft designs.  We will explore how AI, in all its forms, can be a driving force for sustainability in the aviation industry.\"\n",

    "### Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Successful AI efforts are underpinned on the availability and ability to mine insightful data. While large amounts of data exist – ranging from flight trajectories to airport traffic records, surveillance videos, satellite images, audio communications, and aircraft performance logs – extracting sustainability insights and forecasting outcomes remains challenging. As with all AI applications, prudence is critical when addressing matters of safety, security, and privacy.\n",

    "![](images/figure.png){width=\"100%\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will focus on three key areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quantifying Impact**: Identify avenues where AI can more rigorously quantify aviation's climate impact (e.g., developing more precise carbon calculators).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Collaboration**: Develop approaches for data sharing and sanitization that protect commercial interests while enabling open-source initiatives of benefit to all.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Actionable Pathways**: Develop AI-driven implementation strategies, policies, and regulatory directions to reduce carbon and greenhouse gas emissions based on findings from areas 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide focus, the workshop will address sustainability initiatives related to civil airports and aircraft (both freight and passenger), examining both in-air and ground-based environmental impact. For more information, please click <a href=\"more_info.html\">here</a>. \n",
